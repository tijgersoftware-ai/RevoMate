## Style Guide

### JavaScript

- Use ES6+ features when possible
- Use consistent naming:
  - Avoid having two names for one concept
  - Use appropriate array methods
  - Use the shortest variable name that identifies something in their scope
- Use value & onChange as props for input-like components
- Prefer inline event handlers for single use
- Export in place, not afterwards

### Git Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line
